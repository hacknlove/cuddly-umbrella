## details

- I has never used neither react nor graphql before, so it may not follow the react common practices. I think the code is clean and readable though.
- I tried to use redux too, but It seems that I was managing too much complexity without no experience at all with the tools, so in order to be KISS I decided to go with an event helpers that I write for this,  very simple and na√Æve but easy to understand and It does the job.
